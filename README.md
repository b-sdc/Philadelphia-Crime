# Temple University Crime and Budget Analysis

This repo contains the code that supports the following research:

In this project, I explore initiatives that have an effect on crime around the University through the University's campus safety budget. I analyze the crime counts over the past 35 months with their respective yearly budgets using data from OpenPhillyData. The dataset we are using is from the Philadelphia Police Department on crime incidents. I narrow it down to fraud, narcotic/drug violation, theft, and vandalism/criminal mischief crime occurrences in Police District 22 (Temple Campus and where many off-campus residents reside).
